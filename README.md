# -digital-resume

This is my Digital resume (ITW9) and it is to used for future employmentment purposes, I used CSS and HTML languages to design it and made it responsive to all device sizes and platforms that are mostly used all around the world : mobile, tablet and laptop/desktop platforms. It contains links to my github account and contact details. It also showcases my current education level and history, my experience and skills or coding languages that I have learned and used so far. So please enjoy the my wedsite and also if you have any queries or want to work with me in the software development industry...you can kindly use the form in the website to contact me. Thank you.

Yours truly
